# Flask API Template

This repository serves as a template for creating Flask-based APIs. It provides a basic structure to get you started with building RESTful services using Flask.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Flask application on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-api-template.git
   cd flask-api-template
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask server:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the API:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the "Hello, World!" message.

## Using the Template

- Modify `app.py` to add new routes and functionality as needed.
- Update `requirements.txt` to include any additional Python packages your application requires.
